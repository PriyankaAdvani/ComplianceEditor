# Compliance Engine Editor
Compliance engine is an analytical tool designed for an inspection and audit of data held on a Blockchain ledger.

The engine checks compliance policies (in the form of sets of rules) against data (assets) recorded by a Smart-contract on the blockchain ledger.

Unlike the Smart-contract, which checks validity of new assets at the time of recording with a limited set of static rules.

Compliance engine allows to check a large number of ever evolving rules against any already recorded data on the ledger.

It is unconstrained by the performance limitations of Smart-contracts and Blockchain networks.

Provides results in the form of compliance reports and detailed data for further analysis.
